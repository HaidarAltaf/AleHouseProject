# Final-project
Why are we doing this?
To have proof of what ive learnt over the last 9 weeks and have a way of applying it to a project which shows i understand what it does and how each line can impact another.

How I expected the challenge to go.
I thought that it would be significantly harder than it was but i guess because of the teaching it was significantly easier and it was nice to get help when i needed it.

What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
Coding the basics was sigificantly easier than i thought but the testing keeps on causing problems which i do constantly need help on so in the future i will focus on testing so that it causes less problems in the future.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
Making so that it can add people to the same id by name.

screenshots of proof are in the powerpoint doc that is labelled proof of testing
